# Security Policy

Reporting a Vulnerability

- Do not open public GitHub issues for security problems.
- Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting (Security Advisories) or contact the maintainer privately via GitHub.
- Include: description, impact, reproduction steps, affected version, and optional remediation ideas.
- You will receive an acknowledgement within a few days; we will coordinate a fix and disclosure.

Scope

- The toolkit is read-only: it does not modify tenant settings.
- It calls Microsoft APIs; no data is sent to third parties beyond Microsoft.
- Reports may contain sensitive configuration details—store and share them carefully.
